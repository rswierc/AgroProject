## About
### Idea
In this project I builded a simple, but packed with functions, menagement application for farmers.
I came up with this idea after consulting it with my family members who were seeking for such solution.

### Capabilities
It allows you to handle two main parts of every farm: fields and animals.

For fields there are options to add, search, delete and update, any type of informations. You have an opportunity to 
implement agrotechnical treatments. There is also option to add photos. It can be helpfull in case of searching for a specyfic land on map or adding informations about demages coused by the weather.

In case of animals, there are for now to types: cows ans shepps. They both have excactly the same options: add, delete, make notes or create connections between specyfic animals. 


For both, field and animals, there are options to search and filter to be able to easily locate the information sought.

## Used technologies
AgroProject is web based application made mainly with: Python, SQL and HTML.
